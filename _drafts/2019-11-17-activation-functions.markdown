# Activation function: the most important curve in the world ?
In the field of AI, activation function represents the change of state of an artificial neuron. In general, a neuron has two states, up and down or 0 and 1, and for the neuron unit to jump from on state to the other, a function models this characteristic. Originally, the idea of an activation function comes from the activation potential that happens in a biological neuron. When a certain threshold is reached, the neuron fires a response to its neighbors.
As Pedro Domingos said in the Master Algorithm[^1]:
> S curve [...] is the most important curve in the world

What is an S curve and why it is so important in AI ? (at least for connectionists[^2])
S curve
