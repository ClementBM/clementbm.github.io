It has been shown that the tricks judging can be sometimes pretty sloppy. (show link to video `data skateboarding`)

* ants package for design context less language
* diagram of the context less language
* three levels of skateboard language
  1. coding skateboard tricking
     1. precise, and mathematical way of describing a trick
     2. rotation axis, 
  2. standardize skateboark tricking
     1. no ambiguities
     2. still some exception, but clearly listed
  3. natural skateboard tricking
     * ambiguities
     * multiple way of calling the same trick
     * certain shortcut for some tricks
       * ex: cabalerial => fakie 360
* what's the minimal machine that could read tricks skateboarding language

# Grading issues
* not a limited bag of tricks, new tricks come out at every competition
* each skater has its "own" special tricks, which nobody else do
* environment change at each competition, obstacles are different
* a lot of possible combinations
* from 0 to 10, with one decimal


## Judging philosophy

Skateboarding judging doesn’t exist to standardize or define what is considered good skateboarding, it is strictly a tool to rank the performance of skateboarders against each other in a given competition.
Scoring is based on judging the current performance or moment in time.
Judging is based on a skater’s performance against the current field, not against their past performances or ability.

## Overall impression

The judging panel will use the below criteria to formulate a single score based on the overall impression of a skater’s performance within the parameters of the competition.

## Judging criteria (in order of priority)

* Difficulty
  * Trick Performed
  * Obstacle Selection
* Execution
  * Quality of Execution
  * Style
    * Fluidity / Power / Aggression / Aesthetics
    * Speed
    * Height / Distance
    * Quality of Landing
  * Use of Course
    * Variety of Tricks
    * A higher number of tricks will not necessarily result in a higher score as the value of difficulty and execution are more important in formulating an overall impression score.
    * Variety of Obstacles
    * Flow (for runs only)
* Consistency (for runs only)
  * While consistency and runs without any bails are a key factor in any high-scoring skateboarding performance, consistency alone will not be enough to win a competition, as the value of difficulty, execution, and use of course are more important in formulating an overall impression score.

# ANTLR
ANTLR generates the source code for various tools that can be used to recognize, analyze and transform input data relative to a language that is defined in a specified grammar file. The basic types of language processing tools that ANTLR can generates are Lexers (a.k.a scanners, tokenizers), Parsers and, TreeParsers (a.k.a tree walkers, c.f. visitors).

ANTLR reads a language description file called a grammar and generates a number of source code files and other auxiliary files. Most uses of ANTLR generates at least one (and quite often both) of these tools:

* A Lexer: This reads an input character or byte stream (i.e. characters, binary data, etc.), divides it into tokens using patterns you specify, and generates a token stream as output. It can also flag some tokens such as whitespace and comments as hidden using a protocol that ANTLR parsers automatically understand and respect.
* A Parser: This reads a token stream (normally generated by a lexer), and matches phrases in your language via the rules (patterns) you specify, and typically performs some semantic action for each phrase (or sub-phrase) matched. Each match could invoke a custom action, write some text via StringTemplate, or generate an Abstract Syntax Tree for additional processing.

# EBNF
```ebnf
TrickCombo = Stance, { Trick, Manual}, Trick ;
Trick = ( ({ AirTrick, SlideOrGrind }-) | AirTrick), Obstacle ;
AirTrick = Start, [ Rotation ], [ BoardVariation ], [ Grab ] ;
SlideOrGrind = Way, ( (Slide, Reception) | Grind) ;
Rotation = Way, Turn ;

Grab = "Indy grab" | "Mute grab" | "Melon grab" | "Stallfish grab" | "Tail grab" | "Nose grab" | "Nosebone grab";
Reception = "To Fakie" | "To Forward" ;
Stance = "Regular" | "Switch" ;
Start = "Ollie" | "Nollie" ;
BoardVariation = "Kickflip" | "Heelflip" | "Pop Shove-it" | "Frontside Pop Shove-it" | "Hardflip" | "360 flip" | "Varial Kickflip" | "Varial Heelflip" | "Impossible";
Way = "Frontside" | "Backside" ;
Turn = "180" | "360" | "540" ;
Obstacle = "Over the Gap" | "Over the Stairs" | "On flat" | "On rail" | "On curb" | "On hubba";
Slide = "Boardslide" | "Lipslide" | "Noseslide" | "Tailslide" | "Bluntslide" | "Noseblunt slide" ;
Grind = "50-50 grind" | "5-0 grind" | "Nosegrind" | "Crooked grind" | "Feeble grind" | "Smith grind";
Manual = "Nosemanual" | "Manual" ;
```
