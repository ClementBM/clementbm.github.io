It has been shown that the tricks judging can be sometimes pretty sloppy. (show link to video `data skateboarding`)

* ants package for design context less language
* diagram of the context less language
* three levels of skateboard language
* what's the minimal machine that could read tricks skateboarding language


# Grading issues
* not a limited bag of tricks, new tricks come out at every competition
* each skater has its "own" special tricks, which nobody else do
* environment change at each competition, obstacles are different
* a lot of possible combinations
* from 0 to 10, with one decimal

# ANTLR
ANTLR generates the source code for various tools that can be used to recognize, analyze and transform input data relative to a language that is defined in a specified grammar file. The basic types of language processing tools that ANTLR can generates are Lexers (a.k.a scanners, tokenizers), Parsers and, TreeParsers (a.k.a tree walkers, c.f. visitors).

ANTLR reads a language description file called a grammar and generates a number of source code files and other auxiliary files. Most uses of ANTLR generates at least one (and quite often both) of these tools:

* A Lexer: This reads an input character or byte stream (i.e. characters, binary data, etc.), divides it into tokens using patterns you specify, and generates a token stream as output. It can also flag some tokens such as whitespace and comments as hidden using a protocol that ANTLR parsers automatically understand and respect.
* A Parser: This reads a token stream (normally generated by a lexer), and matches phrases in your language via the rules (patterns) you specify, and typically performs some semantic action for each phrase (or sub-phrase) matched. Each match could invoke a custom action, write some text via StringTemplate, or generate an Abstract Syntax Tree for additional processing.
