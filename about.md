![Me, about to drink a delicious hot chocolate](/assets/about/me.jpg){: width="200" style="float: left; padding:15px" }

Hi, I'm Cl√©ment, as you see on the picture, I love hot chocolate. Alas this blog is not about chocolate ~~although it would certainly be useful to mankind~~.
This blog is about another matter I love: **data science**. Why? Because it's one way to pragmatically use data as a means to understand and solve real-world problems.

Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that combines *mathematics/statistic/algorithm* <-> *domain knowledge/context* <-> *coding/databases*.

As a matter of course this blog may be related to one or more of these disciplines :relaxed:

And why another blog? First for myself, because trying to explain something shows me often the holes in my knowledge. It also forces to structure my thoughts and I hope it will be a good record for the future.

To close this page, I make a random selection of quotes :grin:

> People almost invariably arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof but on the basis of what they find attractive. (Blaise Pascal)

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. (Richard P. Feynman)
