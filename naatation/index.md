# Annotation tool for Google Doc™ (NAATation)

NAATation is a free Google Doc™ add-on that helps annotate climate/environmental litigation summaries on Google Doc™.

This add-on enables NAAT's volunteers to structure the information inside textual summaries of the climate trials.

With `NAATation` you can:
* select a piece of text
* annotate it by clicking on the desired attribute in the add-on's sidebar
* export the annotations in a given spreadsheet

## Privacy Policy

### About

This add-on is tightly integrated to your Google account and the data stored in the said account. When installing  the add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace, you will be prompted to authorize different accesses to your Google account. Those authorizations will only be used to perform the service you are requesting from the add-on you have installed.

To remove the add-on access to your Google account, you must uninstall the add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace. Add-ons are created and powered by Google Apps Script, on Google servers.

* Information gathered by `NAATation` will never be sold or shared to external people.
* `NAATation` does not sell in-app products nor advertise to its users (completely and will always be free).
* `NAATation` does not communicate with the user unless he or she has submitted an issue report/has emailed me.

Our App's use of information received, and App's transfer of information to any other app received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the [Limited Use Requirements](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes).
